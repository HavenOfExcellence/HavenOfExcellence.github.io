## Roles

The two main roles are **Node Admin** and **Hub Admin**. Node Admins can view all users in their own node, verify their licenses, and promote users to Node Admin. Hub Admins can do everything Node Admins can, but also view users in their Hub, and promote other users to Hub Admin.



## Viewing users

On the main page, click on the admin tab:

### View a single user

The specific user information will be displayed on your screen.

You can see all of the user's created MT-RAC

You can see all of the feedback the user has received

From this view, you can do a few actions on the user itself.

#### Promote to admin

You can promote the specific user you selected to a `hub` or `node` admin depending on your own admin level

#### Remove from node

Some users that don't belong in the specific node, you can use this function to remove them from his current node

#### Reset password

In the case where the user has forgotten his own password, you can use this feature to set a new password for him

#### Verify licence

This button will give the user a verified tick that indicates his licence is verified.


## Super Admin

Super Admins can do everything Node and Hub Admins can do. They can also view a list of all users and all MT-RACS.
