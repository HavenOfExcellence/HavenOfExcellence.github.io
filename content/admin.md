## Roles

The two main roles are **Node Admin** and **Hub Admin**:

- Node Admins can view all users in their own node, verify their licenses, and promote other users to Node Admin
- Hub Admins can do everything Node Admins can, but also view users in their Hub, and promote other users to Hub Admin.

## Viewing users

On the main page, click on the admin tab:

### Viewing a single user

You may click on any user to view all of their licence information, category, hub and node, and MT-RACs. You can also few all feedback they have received.

You can also take some actions on the user:

- **Verify the user's licences**: this gives them a check mark next to their licence, signifying that it is verified by a node or hub commander
- **Promote the user to node admin** (or hub admin if you are a hub admin)
- **Remove the user from their node**: Some users that don't belong in the specific node, so you can use this function to remove them from their current node
- **Reset the user's password**: In case the user has forgotten their password, you can use this feature to help them set a new password

## Super Admin

Super Admins can do everything Node and Hub Admins can do. They can also view a list of all users and all MT-RACS:
